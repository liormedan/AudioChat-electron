# Requirements Document

## Introduction

מסמך זה מגדיר את הדרישות לבניית דף LLM Manager באפליקציית Audio Chat QT. הדף יאפשר למשתמשים לנהל מודלי שפה גדולים (LLMs), לקבוע הגדרות, לנטר ביצועים ולהתחבר לספקי AI שונים. הדף יכלול ממשק לניהול API keys, בחירת מודלים, הגדרת פרמטרים ומעקב אחר שימוש.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage different LLM providers and models, so that I can choose the best AI service for my audio processing needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the LLM Manager page THEN the system SHALL display a list of available LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
2. WHEN the user selects a provider THEN the system SHALL show available models for that provider
3. WHEN the user configures API credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and store credentials securely
4. WHEN the user selects a model THEN the system SHALL set it as the active model for audio processing
5. WHEN the user saves configuration THEN the system SHALL apply the settings to all AI interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure LLM parameters and settings, so that I can optimize AI responses for my specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses model settings THEN the system SHALL display configurable parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
2. WHEN the user adjusts parameters THEN the system SHALL show real-time preview of how changes affect responses
3. WHEN the user creates custom presets THEN the system SHALL save and allow reuse of parameter combinations
4. WHEN the user tests configurations THEN the system SHALL provide a test interface with sample prompts
5. WHEN the user resets settings THEN the system SHALL restore default values with confirmation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor LLM usage and performance, so that I can track costs and optimize my AI usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views usage statistics THEN the system SHALL display token consumption, API calls, and estimated costs
2. WHEN the user checks performance metrics THEN the system SHALL show response times, success rates, and error statistics
3. WHEN the user sets usage limits THEN the system SHALL enforce limits and notify when approaching thresholds
4. WHEN the user views usage history THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs with filtering and export options
5. WHEN the user analyzes trends THEN the system SHALL display charts and graphs of usage patterns over time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test and compare different LLM models, so that I can choose the most suitable model for my audio processing tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates model testing THEN the system SHALL provide a testing interface with audio-specific prompts
2. WHEN the user compares models THEN the system SHALL run the same prompts across multiple models simultaneously
3. WHEN the user evaluates responses THEN the system SHALL display results side-by-side with quality metrics
4. WHEN the user saves test results THEN the system SHALL store comparisons for future reference
5. WHEN the user benchmarks performance THEN the system SHALL measure and compare response times and accuracy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage API keys and authentication securely, so that my credentials are protected while maintaining easy access to AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them securely in the local database
2. WHEN the user views stored keys THEN the system SHALL display masked versions with options to reveal or edit
3. WHEN the user tests API connectivity THEN the system SHALL verify credentials without exposing sensitive data
4. WHEN the user removes credentials THEN the system SHALL securely delete them with confirmation
5. WHEN the user imports/exports settings THEN the system SHALL handle credentials separately with appropriate warnings
