# Requirements Document - Audio Components

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing essential audio components that are currently missing from the Audio Chat Studio application. These components are critical for providing a complete audio processing and editing experience, including audio playback, waveform visualization, basic editing tools, progress tracking, and user notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Player Widget

**User Story:** As a user, I want to play audio files directly within the application, so that I can listen to my uploaded files without using external applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an audio file THEN the system SHALL display an audio player widget with play/pause controls

3. WHEN a user seeks to a different position THEN the system SHALL update playback position accordingly
4. WHEN an audio file is playing THEN the system SHALL provide volume control functionality
5. WHEN playback reaches the end THEN the system SHALL automatically stop and reset to beginning
6. IF multiple audio files are selected THEN the system SHALL support playlist functionality
7. WHEN an audio file fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Waveform Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual representation of audio waveforms, so that I can better understand the audio content and navigate through it visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio file is loaded THEN the system SHALL generate and display its waveform visualization
2. WHEN a user clicks on the waveform THEN the system SHALL seek to that position in the audio
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL highlight the current playback position on the waveform
4. WHEN a user selects a region on the waveform THEN the system SHALL allow operations on that selection
5. IF the audio file is large THEN the system SHALL optimize waveform rendering for performance
6. WHEN waveform generation fails THEN the system SHALL display a fallback visualization
7. WHEN zoom controls are used THEN the system SHALL adjust waveform detail level accordingly

### Requirement 3: Audio Editor Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic audio editing capabilities, so that I can modify my audio files without external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an audio region THEN the system SHALL provide cut, copy, and paste operations
2. WHEN a user applies volume adjustment THEN the system SHALL modify audio levels in real-time
3. WHEN a user applies fade in/out effects THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition audio levels
4. WHEN a user trims audio THEN the system SHALL remove unwanted portions while preserving quality
5. WHEN a user applies noise reduction THEN the system SHALL process audio to minimize background noise
6. WHEN editing operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain undo/redo functionality
7. IF editing fails THEN the system SHALL preserve original file and show error message
8. WHEN edits are complete THEN the system SHALL allow saving as new file or overwriting original

### Requirement 4: Progress Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see progress of long-running operations, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file upload starts THEN the system SHALL display upload progress with percentage
2. WHEN audio processing begins THEN the system SHALL show processing progress with estimated time
3. WHEN export operation runs THEN the system SHALL indicate export progress and allow cancellation
4. WHEN AI analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL display analysis progress with current step
5. IF an operation can be cancelled THEN the system SHALL provide cancel button functionality
6. WHEN operation completes THEN the system SHALL show completion notification
7. WHEN operation fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and recovery options
8. IF multiple operations run simultaneously THEN the system SHALL show progress for each operation

### Requirement 5: Notification System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about system events, so that I stay informed about operation status and important updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file upload completes THEN the system SHALL show success notification with file details
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display error notification with clear description
3. WHEN AI processing finishes THEN the system SHALL notify user with results summary
4. WHEN export is ready THEN the system SHALL show download notification
5. IF user is away from application THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for later display
6. WHEN user clicks notification THEN the system SHALL navigate to relevant section
7. WHEN multiple notifications exist THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order
8. IF notification is not critical THEN the system SHALL auto-dismiss after timeout period

### Requirement 6: Drag & Drop Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag and drop files into the application, so that I can quickly upload audio files without using file dialogs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user drags audio files over the application THEN the system SHALL highlight drop zones
2. WHEN user drops valid audio files THEN the system SHALL start upload process automatically
3. WHEN user drops invalid files THEN the system SHALL show error message with supported formats
4. WHEN multiple files are dropped THEN the system SHALL process them in batch
5. IF drag operation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL remove visual indicators
6. WHEN files are being dragged THEN the system SHALL show preview of file count and types
7. WHEN drop is successful THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback

### Requirement 7: Keyboard Shortcuts

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts for common actions, so that I can work more efficiently without relying solely on mouse interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user presses Ctrl+O THEN the system SHALL open file upload dialog
2. WHEN user presses Space THEN the system SHALL toggle audio playback
3. WHEN user presses Ctrl+Z THEN the system SHALL undo last editing operation
4. WHEN user presses Ctrl+Y THEN the system SHALL redo last undone operation
5. WHEN user presses Ctrl+S THEN the system SHALL save current work
6. WHEN user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL cancel current operation or close dialogs
7. WHEN user presses F1 THEN the system SHALL display help information
8. IF shortcuts conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize context-specific shortcuts

### Requirement 8: Context Menus
