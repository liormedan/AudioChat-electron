# Audio-Chat Electron App: Development Plan

## App Goal: A Chat-Based Audio Editing Studio

The primary vision is to create an application that seamlessly integrates a chat interface with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) to understand and execute audio editing commands. Users will be able to upload audio, give instructions in plain English (e.g., "remove the background noise," "cut out the silence," "summarize this recording"), and get professionally edited audio files in return.

## Implementation Plan

To achieve this, we will build the application's features in a series of focused phases:

**Phase 1: Core LLM & Chat Foundation**
*   **Objective:** Solidify the chat and LLM management features. This is the brain of the operation.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Functional LLM Manager (`LLMPage`):**
        *   Implement UI for adding, editing, and securely storing API keys for different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
        *   Add a "Test Connection" feature to validate API keys and model access.
        *   Create clear status indicators (Connected, Disconnected, Error) for each provider.
    2.  **Robust Chat Interface (`ChatPage`):**
        *   Ensure the chat UI is polished and can handle conversations with the selected LLM.

**Phase 2: Audio Processing Engine**
*   **Objective:** Implement the core audio editing functionality. This is where the magic happens.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Audio File Management (`AudioPage`):**
        *   Create a user-friendly file drop zone or upload button for audio files.
        *   Display a list of uploaded audio files.
    2.  **AI-Powered Audio Editing:**
        *   Integrate the chat interface with the audio processing backend.
        *   Users will issue commands through chat (e.g., "Transcribe the selected audio").
        *   The backend (`audio_editing_service.py`) will use the LLM to interpret the command and perform the action.
    3.  **Results Display:**
        *   Show processing status (e.g., "Transcribing...", "Complete").
        *   Display results directly in the UI, such as the text from a transcription or a summary.

**Phase 3: Export & Finalization**
*   **Objective:** Allow users to save and export their work.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Export Manager (`ExportPage`):**
        *   List all editable/exportable items (edited audio, chat logs, transcripts).
        *   Provide options for export formats (e.g., MP3, WAV for audio; TXT, JSON for text).
        *   Implement a download mechanism.

**Phase 4: Analytics & User Settings**
*   **Objective:** Add features for monitoring usage and customizing the app experience.
*   **Key Features:**
    1.  **Statistics Dashboard (`StatsPage`):**
        *   Visualize data about processed files, usage time, and other relevant metrics.
    2.  **User Profile & Settings (`ProfilePage`, `SettingsPage`):**
        *   Allow users to manage their profile and customize application settings like the theme.
