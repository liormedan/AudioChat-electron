ay, that's a great question! We've got the core structure and the chat working, which is fantastic. Now, let's
  systematically build out the rest of the UI to make all the functionalities work.

  Based on your project's structure and the pages defined in App.tsx, here's what I suggest we focus on next, in order
  of priority and complexity:

  Phase 1: Enhance LLM Manager (`LLMPage`)

  The LLMPage is currently a placeholder. We need to make it fully functional for managing LLM providers and their
  API keys.

   * Goal: Allow users to add/edit API keys for providers, test their connections, and clearly see the status of each
     provider and model.
   * Key UI Elements to Add:
       * API Key Input Fields: For each provider, a field to enter/update their API key.
       * "Test Connection" Button: For each provider, a button to verify the API key and connection status.
       * "Save API Key" Button: To securely store the entered API key.
       * Detailed Status Indicators: Beyond just connected/disconnected, show error messages if a connection fails.
       * Model Activation: Ensure the UI clearly shows which model is active and allows switching. (We already have the
         backend for this, but the UI needs to be robust).

   * Backend Interaction (already mostly in place in `llm_service.py`):
       * POST /api/llm/providers/api-key (to set API key)
       * GET /api/llm/providers/test-connection (to test connection)
       * POST /api/llm/active-model (to activate a model)

  Phase 2: Implement Audio Processing (`AudioPage`)

  This is a core feature of an "Audio Chat Studio."

   * Goal: Enable users to upload audio files, trigger various processing actions (e.g., transcription, analysis), and
     display the results.
   * Key UI Elements to Add:
       * File Upload/Selection: A clear way to select audio files (e.g., a button to browse, or a drag-and-drop area).
       * Processing Options: Buttons or dropdowns for different audio processing tasks (e.g., "Transcribe," "Analyze,"
         "Summarize").
       * Progress Indicator: Show when a task is in progress.
       * Result Display Area: To show the output of the processing (e.g., transcribed text, analysis report).

   * Backend Interaction (will require new endpoints and logic):
       * POST /api/audio/upload (to handle file uploads)
       * POST /api/audio/process (to trigger processing, using audio_editing_service.py and potentially llm_service.py
         for AI-driven tasks).
       * GET /api/audio/results (to fetch processing results).

  Phase 3: Implement Export Functionality (`ExportPage`)

   * Goal: Allow users to manage and export processed audio or chat transcripts.
   * Key UI Elements to Add:
       * List of Exportable Items: Display a list of items that can be exported (e.g., processed audio files, chat
         logs).
       * Export Options: Choose format (e.g., MP3, WAV, TXT, JSON).
       * Download Button: To initiate the download of the exported file.

   * Backend Interaction (will require new endpoints):
       * GET /api/exports/list
       * POST /api/exports/create (to generate the export file)
       * GET /api/exports/download (to serve the file)

  Phase 4: Implement File Statistics (`StatsPage`)

   * Goal: Provide a dashboard with statistics about audio files and usage.
   * Key UI Elements to Add:
       * Charts/Graphs: Visualize data (e.g., number of files, average duration, processing time).
       * Data Tables: Display detailed statistics.
       * Filters/Date Pickers: To refine the data displayed.

   * Backend Interaction (will require new endpoints):
       * GET /api/stats/summary
       * GET /api/stats/details (using file_stats_data_manager.py and usage_service.py).

  Phase 5: Profile and General Settings (`ProfilePage`, `SettingsPage`)

   * Goal: Allow users to manage their profile information and general application settings.      
   * Key UI Elements to Add:
       * Forms: For user details, theme preferences, notification settings, etc.
       * Save/Reset Buttons: To persist changes.

   * Backend Interaction:
       * GET/POST /api/profile
       * GET/POST /api/settings (using profile_service.py and settings_service.py).

  I suggest we start with Phase 1: Enhancing the LLM Manager (`LLMPage`). This will build upon the existing LLM
  backend and provide a crucial configuration interface for the chat.
