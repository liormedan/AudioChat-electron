# Task 4: Global State Management Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED - All Sub-tasks Implemented

### Implementation Summary

**Task 4: Implement global state management with Zustand** has been successfully completed with all required sub-tasks:

#### ✅ Sub-task 1: Create Zustand stores for application state (UI, user, settings)
- **UI Store** (`src/renderer/stores/ui-store.ts`): Manages theme, notifications, loading states, sidebar, and modal states
- **User Store** (`src/renderer/stores/user-store.ts`): Handles user profile, preferences, recent files, and session data  
- **Settings Store** (`src/renderer/stores/settings-store.ts`): Manages all application settings with persistence

#### ✅ Sub-task 2: Implement state persistence to local storage for user preferences
- User preferences and recent files persist across sessions using Zustand's persist middleware
- Settings automatically save and restore from localStorage
- Graceful error handling for storage operations

#### ✅ Sub-task 3: Set up React Query for server state management and caching
- Configured QueryClient with optimized defaults for caching and retries
- Created query keys factory for consistent key management
- Set up React Query DevTools for development debugging

#### ✅ Sub-task 4: Create custom hooks for state access and mutations
- `use-app-state.ts`: Convenient hooks for all store access patterns
- `use-queries.ts`: React Query hooks for server state management
- `use-store-initialization.ts`: Handles app startup and store initialization

#### ✅ Sub-task 5: Add Redux DevTools integration for debugging
- All Zustand stores have Redux DevTools enabled with proper action names
- State changes are trackable and debuggable in browser DevTools
- Development-only React Query DevTools included

### Key Features Implemented

1. **State Management Architecture**: Clean separation between client state (Zustand) and server state (React Query)
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces and types
3. **Persistence**: Automatic saving/loading of user preferences and settings
4. **Performance**: Optimized with proper memoization and selective subscriptions
5. **Developer Experience**: Debug panels, DevTools integration, and comprehensive error handling
6. **Auto-save**: Settings automatically save after changes with debouncing
7. **Theme Management**: System theme detection with manual override support
8. **Notification System**: Toast-style notifications with auto-dismiss functionality

### Integration Status

- ✅ **App.tsx updated** to use the new state management system
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation** passes without errors
- ✅ **Dependencies installed**: zustand, @tanstack/react-query, @tanstack/react-query-devtools
- ✅ **Store initialization** implemented with proper error handling
- ✅ **Theme integration** working with system theme detection
- ✅ **Notification system** integrated with existing toast system

### Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All required dependencies installed
- ✅ Store structure and types validated
- ✅ Initialization logic tested
- ✅ Mock API integration prepared for future backend connection

### Ready for Next Tasks

The global state management system is now complete and ready to support:
- Python backend integration
- Audio processing workflows
- LLM integration
- File management operations
- User preference management
- Application settings

**Status: ✅ TASK 4 COMPLETE - Ready for production use**
